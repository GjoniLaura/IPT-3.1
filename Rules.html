     In basketball there are different rules of the game that make the game fair and structured. Here are some important rules: <br>
        <li>Scoring: The object of the game is to score points by throwing the ball into the opposing team's basket. A successful throw from inside the three-point line is worth two points, while a successful throw from outside the three-point line is worth three points.<br></li>
        <li>Dribbling: Players are only allowed to move the ball by bouncing (dribbling) on ​​the ground. You have to bounce the ball with one hand and then you can either continue to dribble or pass the ball.<br></li>
        <li>Pass: Players can pass the ball to their teammates to build up attacks. They can throw or shoot the ball with both hands.<br></p>
            <li>Time Game: A team has a certain amount of time to make an attack. In the NBA, the shot clock is 24 seconds. If time runs out without a shot being attempted, the team loses the ball.<br></li>
                <li>Fouls: There are different types of fouls, such as physical contact, handball or illegally holding the opponent. Fouls result in free throws for the opposing team or a throw-in.<br></li>
                    <li>Throw-in: When the ball crosses the touchline or baseline, it is put back into play. The player taking the throw-in must pass the ball over her head into the field of play.<br></li>
                        <li>Quarters and Halftime: A basketball game usually consists of four quarters. In most professional leagues, a quarter lasts 12 minutes. After the first two quarters there is a half-time break.<br></li>
        These rules form the basis of the game of basketball and enable fair and exciting competition. However, there are other specific rules that may vary by league or competition.</li>
